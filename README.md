# SMS-SPAM-CLASSIFIER1
# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier

A simple machine learning web app built with **Streamlit** that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Naive Bayes classifier**, trained on text message data. The app allows users to input an SMS message and get instant prediction results.
